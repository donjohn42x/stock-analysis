## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
One advantage of refactoring code is that it may help with the speed of the code. If we are to reduce the number of steps taken to complete a task, then we can essentially reduce the amount of time it takes for the task to be completed. A few other advantages of refactoring code include using less memory and making the code more simple and readable for the user. If we are able to refactor code and, in doing so, require less memory from the computer, then our computer can be more effective with it's memory. Having readable code for the user or future users is important for knowing where to change certain peices of code if needed or even for debugging purposes. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA Script?
Refactoring the original VBA Script allowed for more data to be analyzed and at a faster rate. In running the refactored code, a large data set was more quickly able to observed and have calculation be conducted for each piece of data. The code also allows for memory to be used less as we did not have to store a lot of data simultaneously, but instead periodically. The refactored code is also readable as it is sectioned off and did not require much code for each section
